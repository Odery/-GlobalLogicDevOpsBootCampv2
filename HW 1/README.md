# Stepan Romanchuk HW No.1 !

In this Homework we have been tasked to prepare a list of resources required to run a typical website (**LAMP/LEMP**) in a private datacenter for one year. Additionally, we had to **Include approximate pricing for the resources**. In the table HW1.xlsx I had done everything that was necessary from me, up to my knowledge of course, there is always room for improvements.
Here is the table with approximate pricing for a **private cloud solution**:

After this I have done some comparison to the AWS cloud. To make the comparison more ideal we need to compare to similar dedicated server options in AWS cloud, so for our example I took three similar servers in AWS cloud. 
**All pricing information were taken from the official AWS pricing chart**
[AWS Pricing for Dedicated Hosts](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/dedicated-hosts/pricing/)
FYI, I could use a calculator at AWS website, however I find it not as precise as it can be.
For the comparison were taken three **a1** general purpose dedicated servers. Region is **US East**.

As we can see from the chart above, the cloud solution provides us with similar or even better terms. And we do not need to pay such a big amount for initial start of our solution.
As chart above shows, we will save **$13,876** US dollars
